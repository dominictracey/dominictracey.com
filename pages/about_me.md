## Heya, thanks for visiting

I've been a software engineer for 25 years and try to stay out in front of the ever-changing landscape that is development. I appreciate the fluidity of the medium we create in, and take satisfaction from solutions that are insightfully conceived and elegantly executed.

I work with both front-end and back-end development, in a broad variety of technologies. I'm not an expert in everything, but I always learn new things every day.

My current "go-to" development environment is React/Redux for front-end work and various choices on the backend including NodeJS/Express, GoLang, Google App Engine.

Docker and Kubernetes aren't really optional for large scale projects these days.

I have written much Java and C# over the years.

## Skills

In addition to development, I also am excellent at architecture, project and program management, and organization/team management.

## Life

I live in Portland, Maine, USA with my partner and daughter. In my busy life I try to make time to get out with friends for climbing and dancing tango.
