## Data-Driven Sports Media

The Rugby Net is a suite of products built on the detailed match statistics now available for professional Rugby Union played around the world. I worked part-time on this project since the 2011 World Cup, with some fantasy rugby games at first and then, as it became more sophisticated a Player Rating Engine that could finally answer the question "Who is the best rugby player in the world?"


Using a sophisticated cloud-based workflow engine I created, the site churned out high quality content that was perfectly suited for social media and had moved up to 100K visitors monthly. The clean, mobile-first UI and carefully crafted information architecture pushed the boundary of what sports media must look like in an age where the media options available to fans are endless.

We partnered with __paddypower.com__ to create some interesting market concepts and spent a few months considering Daily Fantasy Rugby during the chaotic Draft Kings and Fanduel heydey. Thankfully we didn't move forward with that as the market fell apart overnight, but I learned so much in that time about the economics of SaaS.


With fantasy sports not a viable business option, it became apparent that the only real money in the sports media space is in live video streaming. We worked with ESPN as they sorted out their OTT strategy with regards to rugby and other "second tier" sports offered on their __espn3.com__ streaming service. In talking with them and other advisors, the plan became to develop an integrated online fan experience that would begin as a social media experience that included content, conversation, fantasy games and local news. The goal was to evolve a "Netflix of rugby" so I created __live.rugby.net__ as a first step. Broadcast media is an expensive space to crack into, and combined with the market upheaval caused by the cord-cutters there wasn't currently a viable way forward.

The process of developing this new site was incredibly rewarding. I was able to dive deep unabashedly into the latest technologies, worked on some cool open-source project teams and was learning new things every day.
